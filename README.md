# bbanks_assembly_fizzbuzz

This is Fizzbuzz written in Assembly. I just did this for fun and for some assembly practice.

The Fizzbuzz problem
>* Print the numbers 1-100
>* If the number is a multiple of 3 print "Fizz", instead of the number
>* If the number is a multiple of 5 print "Buzz", instead of the number
>* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

Solving the problem in Assembly made me really focus on the logic for the problem.

Concepts used in this project:
* MIPS Assembly Language
